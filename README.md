## Tidy Tuesday with R and Python


I created this repository to show my exploration of the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) datasets. I use them
as a source of fun data and an opportunity to practice building plots. Since I 
have been using ggplot2 for quite a long time, here I want to practice other
data visualization libraries such as [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/).


### My goals

1. Use Plotly (or other packages) instead of ggplot2 for figures.
2. No more than 3 hours from getting the data to the final report generation.

As I get comfortable with plotting in Python I am planning to repeat my 
exercises in Python.

Created an R markdown report as a start. Used Plotly for figures.
